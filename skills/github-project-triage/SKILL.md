# GitHub Project Triage

Always use this skill when the user types `triage`, unless the request explicitly targets a non-GitHub domain. From inside a repo, use the current GitHub project by default. Triage means maintainer-facing item cards: URL, what each issue/PR is about, why it matters, author trust, fit, risk, proof/test state, blockers, and next action. Never return only queue numbers or opaque refs.

Output is URL-first: every surfaced issue/PR/repo item must include its GitHub URL in the first line or first sentence for that item. If giving a shortlist, print one URL per item.

Discovery is `gh`-only. For broad queue discovery across all of Ossian's repos, use `gh search` (one sweep for open PRs, one for open issues) rather than hand-rolling `gh repo list` loops. For per-repo detail, use `gh issue`/`gh pr`.

## Setup

Requires `gh` (authenticated) and `jq`. Confirm auth and identity once:

```bash
gh auth status
gh api user --jq .login   # expected: ossianhempel
```

Default owner for broad triage: `ossianhempel` (all your repos; no orgs by default). Only broaden to other owners/orgs when the user names them, or when the current repo already lives under that owner.

## Local Repo Gate

Before starting work inside any local project, verify the checkout is ready:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git branch --show-current
git pull --ff-only
git status --short --branch
```

Proceed only when the branch is `main`, the pull succeeds, and the worktree is clean. If the branch is not `main`, the pull fails, or `git status --short` shows changes, stop and ask Ossian what to do. Do not switch branches, stash, commit, reset, restore, or clean without explicit direction.

## Scope Rule

If the user says `triage` and the current working directory is a Git repo with a GitHub remote, triage only that project. Do not broaden to all of Ossian's queues unless the user says `broad`, `all`, `everything`, names multiple owners/orgs, or asks for cross-repo triage.

If the repo has `VISION.md`, read it before judging what can be handled autonomously. Use it as the product-fit source of truth, then apply this skill's risk/testability rules. If no `VISION.md` exists, use the autonomous-fit rules below.

Find the current project:

```bash
repo=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$repo" ]; then
  url=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || true)
  repo=$(printf '%s\n' "$url" |
    sed -E 's#^git@github.com:##; s#^https://github.com/##; s#\.git$##')
fi
printf '%s\n' "$repo"
```

Current-project triage starts with:

```bash
gh issue list --repo "$repo" --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,author,labels,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh pr list --repo "$repo" --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,author,isDraft,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,createdAt,updatedAt,url
```

Before acting on any issue or PR, read all comments and treat Ossian/owner comments as authoritative routing instructions. If Ossian says it looks good, needs changes, is superseded, is product-approved, or is not wanted, that overrides bot labels and ordinary triage judgment. If there is no owner comment, use maintainer judgment and say that the call is yours.

Then inspect enough detail to explain every surfaced item. For small queues (about 10 open items or fewer), inspect all items. For larger queues, inspect the top priority slice and say what was not expanded.

```bash
gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" \
  --json number,title,author,body,comments,labels,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh pr view <n> --repo "$repo" \
  --json number,title,author,body,comments,files,commits,isDraft,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh pr diff <n> --repo "$repo" --patch
```

Only comment, close, merge, rerun, or patch with strong evidence.

## Triage Output

When the user says `triage`, always scan open issues and open PRs for the current repo. Return:

- `Autonomous candidates`: items that appear fixable/landable without more product input, with URL, why it qualifies, required verification, and confidence. This is a selection for review, not permission to start work unless the user also asks for autonomous execution.
- `Needs Ossian`: items blocked on owner decision, product direction, missing credentials/access, live-provider proof that cannot be obtained, security/privacy judgment, or an authoritative owner comment requesting changes.
- `Defer/close/supersede`: stale, duplicate, lower-quality, or overlapping items where the likely action is not new code.

For every plausible autonomous candidate, check feasibility before presenting it: use the `oracle` skill or an independent high-reasoning subagent when available. Give the reviewer only task-local evidence and ask whether the item can be completed autonomously, what verification is required, and what could make it unsafe. If no second-model review is available, do the same depth yourself and say so.

## Autonomous Work Mode

When the user says `do work autonomously`, `work you can do autonomously`, `keep going`, or similar, do not stop after a queue summary or one local patch. Treat it as permission to process the eligible issue/PR queue sequentially until no safe autonomous item remains, each item is landed/closed/deferred with proof, or a blocker requires Ossian.

Never work multiple tickets at once. For each item:

1. Read the issue/PR, related code, docs, CI, and `VISION.md` if present; use official docs / web search when facts may be stale or unclear.
2. Decide if it is autonomous:
   - Go: performance improvements unless complexity rises too much; bugfixes with repro/root cause and verification path; small UI/UX tweaks; docs fixes; narrow test/internal fixes; low-risk dependency/CI cleanup with green proof.
   - Ask first: new features, product/vision choices, broad behavior changes, risky dependencies, security-sensitive changes without strong proof, live-provider work without usable credentials, anything that cannot be end-to-end tested.
   - Refactor preference: choose a clean bounded refactor when it is the better fix for an autonomous item; do not use "small patch" as the default if it leaves worse design.
3. Implement or fix the PR in the best maintainable way. Prefer updating the contributor PR when writable; otherwise recreate locally with credit.
4. Verify locally and live end-to-end when possible. For macOS UI behavior, use the `peekaboo` skill for screenshots / UI proof; for web UI, use the `agent-browser` skill. For API/provider behavior, use a real usable key/account through the expected secret workflow when available. If access is missing, stop before pretending the item is done and ask Ossian for help.
5. Run Codex Auto Review (`codex`) before commit/land unless trivial/docs-only or explicitly skipped; address accepted/actionable findings.
6. Ensure CI is green, PR description/changelog are good, land/close/comment with evidence, then return to `main`, pull `--ff-only`, and verify a clean worktree before selecting the next autonomous item.
7. After every landed PR, post a PR comment with exactly how it was tested: local commands, live/UI/API proof, CI run/check state, landed commit, and any caveats. If verification images apply, attach them to the comment; if you cannot attach images, say so and include the screenshot path instead of silently omitting them.

Do not end autonomous mode with dirty files or an unpushed local fix unless blocked. If blocked, state the exact blocker, current branch/status, proof already gathered, and the next decision needed.

Autonomous work is still bounded by scope: current repo by default; broad/all queues only when the user asked for broad/all/everything or named owners/orgs.

## Trust Signals

Include author/opener trust for every non-maintainer item you recommend acting on. For low-risk Dependabot/internal items, a terse bot/internal trust line is enough.

Use the bundled helper:

```bash
skills/github-project-triage/scripts/github-activity.sh --repo <owner/repo> --global <login>
```

Trust output must stay factual:

```text
Trust: @login; acct 2021-04-03; repo 2 PRs/1 issue/0 commits in 12mo; GitHub 9 PRs/3 issues/12 reviews; signal: known contributor / new drive-by / bot / unknown.
```

Do not treat trust as proof. It changes review depth, not correctness.

## Item Evaluation

Classify each item:

- `bug`: require repro/log/failing test/current-main proof when feasible; identify root cause before recommending fix/merge.
- `feature`: require end-to-end test plan. If live validation needs a provider key, account, device, service, model access, or paid API, say exactly what credential/access is missing before work can be considered complete.
- `dependency`: explain package group, major/minor risk, failing checks, runtime/engine changes, and whether to split.
- `security`: raise priority, require careful code-path proof, tests, and trust/context; do not merge on rationale alone.
- `docs/internal`: lower risk, but still explain user-visible relevance and stale/generated churn risk.

Judge:

- `Fit`: good / mixed / poor, with one reason.
- `Risk`: low / medium / high, with blast radius.
- `Proof`: current CI, local repro, failing test, live E2E, or missing proof.
- `Blocker`: first-time contributor CI approval, failing check, missing key, unclear product direction, stale branch, untrusted/broad diff, no repro, conflicts.
- `Next`: approve CI, run test, request repro, split PR, patch locally, merge after green, close with proof, or defer.

## Fast Queue Map

Use this only when the scope is broad. Sweep all open work across your repos with two `gh search` calls, then group by repo.

Open PRs across all your repos, primary triage order:

```bash
gh search prs --owner ossianhempel --state open --limit 200 \
  --json repository,number,title,author,createdAt,updatedAt,url |
  jq -r 'group_by(.repository.nameWithOwner)
    | sort_by(-length)
    | .[] | "\(.[0].repository.nameWithOwner): \(length) open PRs"'
```

Open issues across all your repos, second pass when issues matter:

```bash
gh search issues --owner ossianhempel --state open --include-prs=false --limit 200 \
  --json repository,number,title,author,createdAt,updatedAt,url |
  jq -r 'group_by(.repository.nameWithOwner)
    | sort_by(-length)
    | .[] | "\(.[0].repository.nameWithOwner): \(length) open issues"'
```

Notes:
- `gh search` skips archived repos by default. To include them, add the repos explicitly or pass `--archived` only when the user asks for "all", "everything", or archaeology.
- To restrict the sweep to non-fork sources, cross-check against `gh repo list ossianhempel --source --no-archived`.
- Preserve the PR-count order when summarizing. Do not include a lower-PR repo while omitting a higher-PR repo from the same scope. Repos with zero issues but open PRs are still triage-relevant.

## Detail Pass

After a broad queue map, inspect only the top repos unless the user explicitly wants exhaustive detail.

```bash
gh issue list --repo <owner/name> --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,author,labels,createdAt,updatedAt,url
gh pr list --repo <owner/name> --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,author,isDraft,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,createdAt,updatedAt,url
```

For PRs that look mergeable or suspicious, pull maintainer-grade state:

```bash
gh pr view <n> --repo <owner/name> --json number,title,state,author,isDraft,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt,url
gh pr diff <n> --repo <owner/name> --patch
gh run list --repo <owner/name> --branch <branch> --limit 10
```

For issues that may already be fixed, switch to `gh issue view`, then inspect current source before commenting or closing.

To find duplicate or related threads before commenting or closing, search across your repos:

```bash
gh search issues --owner ossianhempel "<keywords>" --limit 30 --json repository,number,title,state,url
gh search prs    --owner ossianhempel "<keywords>" --limit 30 --json repository,number,title,state,url
```

## Triage Heuristics

Prioritize:

- PRs with green or nearly-green CI, recent maintainer activity, or low-risk dependency/docs/test changes.
- Repos with high open PR counts but recent activity, because they often hide obvious cleanup.
- Issues that are reproducible, recently reported, or block releases.
- Security, release, auth, install, CI, and data-loss reports before cosmetic items.
- Bugs with clear current-main reproduction and narrow owner path.
- Features only when live validation is possible or the missing access is explicit.

Deprioritize:

- Archived repos unless the user asked for them.
- Fork-only queues unless the fork is actively maintained by Ossian.
- Old broad feature requests with no reproduction or owner signal.
- Repos with missing/removable remotes until local state is clarified.
- Feature/provider PRs that need unavailable API keys or accounts for end-to-end proof.
- Broad generated changes without a clear user problem, test plan, or trusted author signal.

## Output Shape

For current-project triage, answer with:

```text
Repo: owner/name
Source: gh list/view/diff/checks, local source/tests where inspected

Immediate:
- #123 PR: title
  What: one-line summary in plain words.
  Type/Fit/Risk: bug|feature|dependency; good|mixed|poor; low|medium|high because ...
  Trust: @login; acct date; repo/global activity; known/unknown/bot.
  Proof: CI/repro/test/e2e state.
  Blocker: none / missing key / first-time CI approval / failing lint / unclear direction.
  Next: exact maintainer action.

Needs judgment:
- #124 issue: ...

Defer/close:
- #125 issue: ...

Skipped:
- <why>
```

For a broad scan, answer with:

```text
Owner scanned: ossianhempel
Source: gh search prs/issues sweep, plus gh for selected PRs/issues

Top queues:
- owner/repo: X issues, Y PRs; why it matters; next action

Immediate actions:
- <small obvious merge/fix/comment/rerun, with item summary>

Needs judgment:
- <larger/ambiguous queues, with item summary>

Skipped:
- archived/forks/missing access/etc.
```

When the user asks to act, keep going: inspect the selected PRs/issues with `gh`, rerun/fix CI, comment/close/merge only with evidence, and report exact commands/proof.
