# Plan Inbox

Use this skill to surface saved work that might otherwise disappear: unfinished
`docs/plans/` implementation plans and upstream `docs/brainstorms/`
requirements docs that have not become plans yet.

The bundled script does the repetitive scan. Run it first, then interpret the
results for the user.

```bash
node skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js
```

## Modes

Current project:

```bash
node skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js
```

Specific project:

```bash
node /path/to/agent-scripts/skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js --project /path/to/project
```

Global scan across sibling projects under `~/Developer` and `~/repos`:

```bash
node /path/to/agent-scripts/skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js --global
```

Plans plus brainstorm backlog:

```bash
node skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js --brainstorms
```

JSON for another script:

```bash
node skills/plan-inbox/scripts/plan-inbox.js --json --brainstorms
```

## What To Report

Default output focuses on plans whose status is not complete. Report:

- project
- status
- date/type from filename when available
- title
- path

If `--brainstorms` is relevant, include brainstorm docs that still have
`Requirements` or `Unknown` status and are not linked from any plan.

## Status Model

Use these plan statuses:

- `Draft` — written but not committed to
- `Ready` — approved / ready to implement
- `In Progress` — actively being implemented
- `Blocked` — waiting on something
- `Completed` — implemented and verified
- `Superseded` — replaced by another plan
- `Abandoned` — intentionally not doing it
- `Unknown` — missing or unrecognized status

Treat only `Completed`, `Superseded`, and `Abandoned` as closed. Everything else
belongs in the plan inbox.

Use these brainstorm statuses:

- `Requirements` — captured, no plan yet
- `Planned` — linked to a plan
- `Superseded` — replaced by another brainstorm or plan
- `Dropped` — intentionally not pursuing
- `Unknown` — missing or unrecognized status

Treat only `Planned`, `Superseded`, and `Dropped` as closed for brainstorms.

## Updating Docs

When implementation finishes, update the plan line:

```markdown
> **Status:** Completed
```

When a brainstorm becomes a plan, update the brainstorm line and add the plan
path near the top:

```markdown
> **Status:** Planned  ·  **Depth:** Standard
> **Plan:** docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-001-feature-topic-plan.md
```

Do not mark a plan `Completed` unless the implementation has actually landed
and been verified. If the work was replaced or intentionally dropped, use
`Superseded` or `Abandoned` instead so it leaves the active inbox without
pretending it shipped.
